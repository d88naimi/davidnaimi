As one of the lead engineers, I played a pivotal role in architecting the application, utilizing MUI design systems in conjunction with Tailwind CSS to craft reusable custom components that enhanced the app's functionality and aesthetics. I developed a comprehensive check-in page for a tire company using React, Next.JS, employing the useReducer and context APIs for state management. The page seamlessly integrates features for customer check-in, tire ordering, and service scheduling like oil changes and tire rotations. Leveraging APIs for address retrieval, users can quickly input their address, facilitating fast customer creation or retrieval. This streamlined process ensures efficient service delivery while also handling vehicle registration, inspection, and accurate tire cost estimation. "},

David excelled as a student in our part-time web development bootcamp program and transitioned into a reliable, knowledgeable and respected TA for our students in our full-time web development program. I feel very lucky to have witnessed and been apart of David's evolution from a student learner to teacher. David exudes confidence and is always willing to go the extra mile for the greater good. David is simply one of the good ones and he made managing him a breeze. I look forward to finding additional ways for us to continue to work together in the future.",
