It has been an absolute pleasure working with David directly as both a student and instructional assistant over the past year. David excelled as a student in our part-time web development bootcamp program and transitioned into a reliable, knowledgeable and respected TA for our students in our full-time web development program. I feel very lucky to have witnessed and been apart of David's evolution from a student learner to teacher. David exudes confidence and is always willing to go the extra mile for the greater good. David is simply one of the good ones and he made managing him a breeze. I look forward to finding additional ways for us to continue to work together in the future.",
